📊 NumPy Practice Sets
This repository contains practice scripts to help you master NumPy, Python's powerful numerical computing library. Each script focuses on a specific operation or concept, with clear examples.

📁 Folder Structure & Topics
Filename	Topic
add_operation.py	Adding elements to arrays (insert, append)
aggregation.py	Aggregate functions (sum, mean, min, max, etc.)
broadcasting.py	Broadcasting rules and operations
create.py	Creating arrays (zeros, ones, arange, linspace, etc.)
delete_operation.py	Deleting elements from arrays
missing_values_handling.py	Handling missing or NaN values
properties&operations.py	Basic array properties and element-wise operations
reshaping&manupulating.py	Reshaping and manipulating arrays
slicing&indexing.py	Slicing, indexing, and subsetting arrays
stacking&spiting.py	Stacking and splitting arrays
vectorisation.py	Vectorized operations for performance

✅ Key Learning Outcomes
Create and manipulate arrays efficiently.

Use insertion, deletion, and appending operations.

Perform aggregate calculations.

Understand and apply broadcasting.

Reshape, slice, index, stack, and split arrays.

Handle missing data gracefully.

Use vectorized operations for faster computation.

📌 Notes
Each script demonstrates one or more related concepts with easy-to-follow examples.

Scripts are independent; you can run them in any order.

Perfect for building a solid foundation in NumPy for data science, machine learning, or data engineering.
